# House Price Prediction using Simple Linear Regression in Microsoft Excel

This repository contains a project aimed at predicting house prices based on square footage using simple linear regression techniques implemented in Microsoft Excel.

## Overview

Predictive analytics is a powerful tool for forecasting future trends and outcomes based on historical data. In this project, we utilize simple linear regression to predict house prices using square footage as the independent variable.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of square footage and corresponding house prices. We have a total of 56 observations.

## Methodology

- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset was already a cleaned data.
- **Model Training**: Simple linear regression model was trained using Microsoft Excel's built-in functionalities.
- **Prediction**: The trained model was used to predict house prices for given square footage values.
- **Evaluation**: Model performance was evaluated using R Square (coefficient of determination).

## Results

- The regression equation obtained: `price = 0.1177(sqft) - 66.54`
- R Square value: 0.4921 (49.21% of the variance in house prices is explained by square footage)
- Coefficients: Slope (0.1177) and Intercept (-66.54)

## Insights

- The model achieved a prediction accuracy of 49.21% based on R Square.
- With more data, the model's accuracy could potentially improve.


## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of simple linear regression for house price prediction using Microsoft Excel. It serves as a starting point for understanding predictive analytics and regression modeling techniques.
